# LeadFlow AI — execution log

> All activity is in this response/session, not asynchronous background work.
> Main/production are unchanged. Each implementation lives in a separate draft PR.

## 2026-11-09 — Setup
- Read main-branch AGENTS.md, package.json, public form, actions, scoring and checkout code; also read the unmerged visual contract from feature/agent-ops-dashboard-20261109.
- Confirmed that static /form references params.slug even though the URL does not contain a slug; this is the first targeted bug.
- Created the prioritized TASKS.md queue on tracking branch `ops/overnight-tracking-20261109`.
- No build/test assertions yet. No money spent, secrets accessed, customer data read, or production touched.

## P0-01 — Static /form crash guard
- **Draft PR:** https://github.com/nikkushrivastava0-a11y/leadflow-ai/pull/12
- **Source:** `src/app/form/page.tsx` — replace invalid dynamic slug assumption with redirect to `/`. Dynamic `/form/[slug]` unchanged.
- **Build:** Vercel preview `dpl_9EhKEBnzbYzyVNMboCEHmEmfCB3z` at commit `c62cff3` is READY; log confirms compiled route `/form`, no build errors.
- **Tests:** No local execution possible because isolated container cannot resolve GitHub. Authenticated browser assertion of `GET /form` redirect not yet performed; no claim of user-flow verification.
- **How to verify:** Open the PR preview, visit `/form` and confirm homepage redirect; then visit a valid `/form/{clientSlug}` after DB restoration.
- **Status:** PR prepared + build passed; live route QA pending (does not block next independent fix).

## P0-02 — Authenticated checkout initiation
- **Draft PR:** https://github.com/nikkushrivastava0-a11y/leadflow-ai/pull/13
- **Source:** `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` — guard Razorpay order creation behind `auth.getUser()`; missing payment credentials produce 503 instead of attempting SDK init; no-store success response.
- **Build:** Vercel preview `dpl_7xwR4fHHYBzVtXTxkRnN7JDgsPyZ` for commit `e6192a4` is READY, route `/api/checkout` compiled, build log contains no errors.
- **Tests:** No live authenticated/unauthenticated API request tests performed. API keys and client sessions were not accessed. No real payment started.
- **How to verify:** With preview, POST without Supabase session must return 401; with valid session but no configured keys must return 503. The latter should be tested in a nonproduction environment.
- **Status:** Guard implementation committed and preview build passed. **P0-03 payment verification, ownership persistence and rate limiting remain required before accepting money.**
